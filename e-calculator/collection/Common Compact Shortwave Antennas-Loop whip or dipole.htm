<h1>Common Compact Shortwave Antennas</h1>

<p id="subtitle">Loop, whip or dipole?</p>

<p id="erster">I have been fascinated by electrically small loop antennas 
(circumference 2&#960;r&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&#955;/2) for a long time. Then one 
day I decided to find out what it is that makes them perform so well, at least 
for receiving purposes. A number of Google searches, a good bit of reading and 
some calculations later, here's what I found on small antennas in general. 
(Y'know, trying to explain a subject you don't understand properly is a 
brilliant way of learning a lot about it.)</p>

<h2 id="general">Basics</h2>

<p>You have to keep one thing in mind when physically small antennas 
(<code>&lt;&lt;&#955;/2</code>, typically <code>&lt;&#955;/10</code>) are 
concerned: TANSTAAFL. Or as <a href="http://www.aa5tb.com/loop.html">AA5TB</a> 
so neatly puts it,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can have any <em>TWO</em> of the following antenna parameters:</p>

<ul>

<li>SMALL SIZE (in terms of wavelength)</li>

<li>EFFICIENCY</li>

<li>BROADBAND</li>

</ul>

<p>You cannot have all three.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Thus we will have to decide between efficiency and broadband operation later 
on.</p>

<p>It is useful to distinguish between <em>transmission</em> and 
<em>reception</em> applications. The reason is that on the shortwave ranges, 
noise levels are quite high, so that the RSGB Communication Handbook stated a 
receiver noise figure of 10&nbsp;dB to be quite sufficient even for the highest 
ranges decades ago, assuming a fullsize dipole. On the lower bands, 
requirements are much more relaxed still, with atmospheric noise easily 
equalling 20 to 30&nbsp;dB. Therefore you could easily get away with either a 
receiver with relatively modest sensitivity on a fullsize antenna or a more 
sensitive receiver with an antenna that has considerable loss. Therefore an 
antenna with 20&nbsp;dB loss (a modest 1% radiation efficiency) may very well 
be able to hear everything. However, the signal levels produced when 
transmitting with it will be rather pitiful (as in 20&nbsp;dB below those of a 
fullsize dipole with decent height).</p>

<h2 id="electric">Monopoles (vertical / whip) and dipoles</h2>

<h3 id="mono-di">Relations between monopoles and dipoles</h3>

<p>The dipole probably is the most fundamental type of antenna out there from a 
theoretical point of view, going right back to <span lang="de">Heinrich 
Hertz</span> himself. It is also commonly used for transmission purposes, while 
the average SWL has certainly seen its monopole relatives, notably telescopic 
whips.</p>

<p>Now this is not the place to reiterate short dipole theory ñ you can 
find enough of that on the web 
(<a href="http://www.antenna-theory.com/antennas/shortdipole2.php">here's an 
example</a>). However, once you have that, a vertical or whip is not hard to 
understand.</p> 

<p>A whip antenna is nothing but a short and comparatively thick monopole 
(vertical) over receiver ground. Any monopole needs a counterpoise at constant 
potential (typically, ground) that serves as a "mirror" and thus completes a 
dipole of twice the length. The impedance seen by a connected receiver will 
only be half as high as between two dipole halves, but other than that the 
theory for dipoles will apply. (Of course if you want to connect something to 
a monopole, you'll need an unbalanced connection, while for a dipole it would 
be balanced.)</p>

<h3 id="short-di">A look at short dipoles</h3>

<p>Now it is known that a short dipole (less than one tenth the wavelength) is 
predominantly capacitive. Let's have a look at the commonly used equivalent 
circuit as given in the book "Antenna Handbook: Antenna theory" by Y. T. Lo and 
S. W. Lee (you may notice this is actually unbalanced so would apply to a 
monopole, but as we've seen it can be treated in the same way):</p>

<p>Only the radiation resistance actually contributes signal. It increases with 
the square of dipole length to wavelength ratio, i.e. 
<code>(l/&#955;)≤</code>, so it'll get pretty small for very short dipoles. 
It's barely 2&nbsp;&#937; for <code>l/&#955;=1/10</code>, and at 
<code>l/&#955;=1/50</code> it drops to a measly 80&nbsp;m&#937;. (But 
wait until you've seen the numbers for loops!)</p>

<p>Loss resistance originates in the dipole material's finite conductivity and 
increases with frequency due to skin effect 
(approximately <code>R<sub>o</sub>&nbsp;&#8733;&nbsp;&#8730;(f)</code> once skin 
depth is smaller than conductor radius/thickness). It usually is much smaller 
than radiation resistance for a "full-grown" dipole, but can easily become as 
big or bigger than radiation resistance for short dipoles with low conductor 
diameter and/or non-ideal materials (e.g. steel wire).</p>

<p>In a short dipole, the effect of inductance is rather negligible.</p>

<p>That leaves us with capacitance. This turns out to be quite small, commonly 
in the single-digit pF range or not far beyond. Thus it contributes a large 
reactance (imaginary part of the impedance) in series, with a magnitude well in 
the k&#937; range for the lower shortwave ranges. Thus it obviously dominates 
the whole antenna impedance.</p>

<p>Now try getting any noteworthy amount of RF power through that. Not easy! 
Here we have to remember that power transfer is highest if load impedance is 
the conjugate complex of source impedance. Therefore what we have to do is 
cancelling out the cap's large negative reactance by an equal amount of 
positive reactance, usually by inserting an inductance in series or in parallel 
(with the parallel version having the advantage of transforming the very small 
radiation and loss resistance up, easily in the hundreds of k&#937;, which 
gives much higher voltages and invites use of a JFET or MOSFET based 
amplifier).</p> 

<p>You'll need a mighty big inductor there, which will contribute a healthy 
share of loss resistance on its own, but it'll improve things considerably 
nonetheless. Loss resistance for a fixed coil can be optimized by using the 
right size and material of iron powder or ferrite core, depending on frequency 
range and required power levels.</p>

<p>But alas, this introduces a new problem: The impedance of an inductor 
increases with frequency while for the capacitor it's the other way around, so 
the cancellation will work for one frequency only! In practice this will be an 
area that might be a few 10 or 100&nbsp;kHz wide depending on losses, but still 
this is quite narrowband. Remember we have to decide between high efficiency 
and broadband operation?</p> 

<p>We could make the whole affair work over a certain frequency range by simply 
using a variable inductor. However, these aren't exactly common, though you 
will find them in some antenna tuners and power amplifiers. Alternatively, one 
could use a parallel LC network with multiple taps on the L and a more common 
variable capacitor. (Simple whip antenna tuners like the ADDX-PRE-1 work like 
that.)</p>

<p>If we are trying to use this antenna over a really wide bandwidth (like 
100&nbsp;kHz to 30&nbsp;MHz), just about all we can do is make sure that our 
input impedance is reasonably high towards the lower frequencies. Using some 
JFET or MOSFET amp would be one possible option (as it would be for the 
parallel-L-tuned dipole). The noise figure of the whole shebang will probably 
be rather lousy in some places.</p>

<h3 id="mono-prob">Further problems of monopoles</h3>

<p>In order for a monopole to be completed to a full dipole, a good ground is 
required. That's why vertical antennas are commonly used with radials which 
greatly increase conductivity. Now unfortunately any battery-operated receiver 
with a whip antenna has a problem in this very area: The ground connection is 
arbitrarily lousy! Unless an explicit ground connection is established, pretty 
much all you have is some capacitive coupling from circuit ground to the 
surface underneath. The whole affair could include a good bit of old-fashioned 
resistance, too, depending on the conductivity of things in the path to ground 
potential (typically furniture, walls and such). So what does this look like in 
the equivalent circuit diagram?</p>

<p>Oh dear. Reactance gets even larger, and even if we managed to cancel this 
out, only a teeny tiny part of the remaining resistance is actually made up by 
radiation resistance. As any owner of a portable shortwave receiver will be 
able to attest, whip sensitivity on batteries is rather lousy and much improves 
upon establishing an explicit ground connection or merely attaching an external 
power supply.</p>

<h3 id="di-fieldimp">Field impedance</h3>

<p>Short dipoles and monopoles are also called "electric" antennas because they 
primarily react to the electric component of the electromagnetic field, i.e. 
their field impedance is high. 
<a href="http://www.w8ji.com/magnetic_receiving_loops.htm">As W8JI points 
out</a>, this only applies for distances up to about &#955;/10, but that's 
usually sufficient to include a large number of in-house interference 
generators with their respective "antennas", also of the "electric" variety in 
many cases.</p>

<p>That being said, monopoles, improperly balanced dipoles (more common than 
you may think) and various other unbalanced forms of antennas may be better in 
terms of noise than commonly given credit for. A few common-mode chokes in the 
feedline may work wonders (yet more improvement is to be had with more of them 
on the "antennas" of RFI generators). Of course grounding should only be either 
at the antenna or at the receiver, not both. If there is a ground loop, part of 
the signal current will be common mode.</p>

<p>The field impedance of free space is <code>120&#960;&nbsp;&#937; &#8773; 
377&nbsp;&#937;</code> btw.</p>

<h2 id="loop">Loop antennas</h2>

<h3 id="small-loops">Small loops</h3>

<p>A small loop antenna (circumference <code>2&#960;r&nbsp;&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&#955;/2</code>) 
is essentially an inductor with a cross-section big enough to pick up 
electromagnetic fields (predominantly the magnetic part) halfway well. It's 
basically the magnetic counterpart to a short dipole. Practical ones are 
frequently tuned, and we'll see why this is shortly. Here's an equivalent 
circuit:</p>

 +----------------------------------+------o----+
</pre>

<p>Radiation resistance (which is the only part actually contributing our 
signal during reception) differs noticeably from that of the short dipole: It 
increases with the 4th power of the circumference to wavelength ratio, i.e. 
<code>(2&#960;r/&#955;)<sup>4</sup></code>. One could also say it increases 
with loop area A squared. In fact, as long as the loop remains reasonably thin, 
adding more turns N leads to an effective loop area of <code>N*A</code> since 
from far away, it looks like a single turn with N times the current. Small 
loops have very small radiation resistances ñ a one-turn circular loop 
with <code>2&#960;r/&#955;=1/10</code> (that's about 3&nbsp;m in diameters at 
3&nbsp;MHz) can offer only 20&nbsp;m&#937;, and for 
<code>2&#960;r/&#955;=1/50</code> this shrinks to a modest 30&nbsp;µ&#937;. 
Yep, that's microohms.</p> 

<p>As an inductor typically involves a conductor of some length (which could be 
a wire or a copper tube), some losses in there are obviously inevitable. If the 
antenna is supposed to have any kind of efficiency later on, they have to be 
made very small due to the modest radiation resistance.</p>

<p>Any inductance also has a parasitic parallel capacitance, typically 
inter-winding capacitance (which can be less than 1&nbsp;pF to multiple pF 
depending on the loop). This leads to the phenomenon of self-resonance and 
limits the maximum frequency of a tuned loop. Note that for a given inductance, 
the lower-diameter loop with more windings will generally exhibit the higher 
inter-winding capacitance.</p>

<p>That leaves us with the inductance itself. Its value tends to range between 
a few µH for a typical single-turn SW loop to several hundred µH for their 
MW and LW brethren. For example, a 3&nbsp;m dia. single-turn loop has an 
inductance of about 6..7&nbsp;µH, equivalent to a reactance 
<code>X<sub>L</sub>&nbsp;&#8773;&nbsp;+120&nbsp;&#937;</code> at 3&nbsp;MHz. 
(Radiation resistance is about 20&nbsp;m&#937; then.) That sure seems easier 
to tune out than the values far in the negative kOhm range that we saw with 
short dipoles. 
<br>A small 9" dia. loop with 25 windings occupying about 1" like the Tecsun 
AN-200 has about 250&nbsp;µH (going by the 
<a href="http://www.icorp.net/users/kev/tesla/formula.htm">Bob's Tesla Web Lab 
formula</a>), giving an X<sub>L</sub> of about 800&nbsp;&#937; to 
2.7&nbsp;k&#937; across the MW band. Since my sample will tune up to pretty 
much exactly 2&nbsp;MHz, that means minimum capacitance (including 
inter-winding) is about 25&nbsp;pF, down from a maximum of about 400&nbsp;pF. 
Not a bad little tuning cap there, and wire routing seems quite solid, too. </p>

<h3 id="loop-bw">Implications on efficiency and bandwidth</h3>

<p>As in the case of short dipoles and monopoles, we will have to decide 
between efficiency and bandwidth. If we want a decent kind of efficiency, the 
large positive reactance has to be cancelled out. This can be done with a 
series capacitor or the more useful impedance-transforming parallel capacitor 
variant.</p>

<p>The parallel capacitor version is particularly neat, since the tuning 
capacitance, parasitic (inter-winding) capacitance and input capacitance of a 
following FET amplifier stage (whose input impedance typically is in the 
hundreds of kOhms in parallel to a few pF) are all in parallel and can be 
lumped together. This makes determining minimum sum capacitance and thus 
highest tunable frequency rather easy. Again, this kind of circuit transforms 
our radiation and loss resistance up. Obviously the tuning capacitor will also 
contribute some losses, not terribly much for sure but remember that our 
signal-contributing radiation resistance is pretty low to begin with. (And to 
bust some myths, no, a mechanical varicap is not per se better than a varicap 
diode in that regard. Not the usual AM radio ones with wipers at least. You 
can build very high-Q mechanicals though.)</p>

<p>Of course one does not need to attach a FET amplifier there, part of the 
loop can also be used to form a balun for impedance transformation to e.g. a 
50&nbsp;&#937; system. Single-turn shortwave loops typically have a small 
coupling winding at the side opposite of the tuning capacitor, where currents 
are highest. If you have ever used an external tuned loop to boost signal 
levels on a portable receiver with an internal ferrite rod using "inductive 
coupling" (in which case you can probably attest to the effectiveness of this 
method), that's the same effect. A ferrite rod is nothing but a loop would on a 
high permeability (µ<sub>r</sub>) core after all. <a href="http://stephan.win31.de/ind-coupling-5.asc">Here's something for you</a> if you feel like simulating inductive coupling in 
LTspice.</p> 

<p>As already with the short dipole, broadband use is a bit of a mess as 
antenna impedance is rather non-constant. At least reactance becomes smaller as 
frequency decreases, but that advantage is eaten up by the more quickly 
decreasing radiation resistance, so in the end 
<code>Q&nbsp;=&nbsp;|X<sub>L</sub>|/R<sub>r</sub></code> behaves about the 
same (<code>Q&nbsp;&#8733;&nbsp;1/f≥</code>).</p>

<p>In fact, when taking a look into formal small antenna theory 
(<a href="http://www.mhprofessional.com/downloads/products/0071625534/0071625534_chap01.pdf">as in this book chapter by <cite>Chalas, Fujimoto, Volakis, 
Sertel</cite></a>), we find that there are fundamental limits as to how low 
antenna Q (or how high relative bandwidth for a tuned version) can actually go 
even for superconducting antennas, and while people still haven't agreed 
entirely on the details, you usually find 
<code>Q<sub>min</sub>&nbsp;&#8733;&nbsp;1/(ka)≥</code> if the antenna is 
contained within a sphere of radius a; 
<code>k&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&#960;/&#955;&nbsp;=&nbsp;2&#960;f/c</code>, so there's our 
<code>1/f≥</code> dependency again.</p>

<h3 id="loop-dir">Balance and directivity</h3>

<p>A small loop, much like a short dipole, is a "complete" antenna ñ and 
that applies even when it is run unbalanced. Therefore it exhibits a workable 
amount of directivity (nulling ability), not being restricted to "vertical" 
operation like typical monopoles are. A properly balanced loop will, however, 
do better in terms of directionality, especially on the higher frequencies. I 
presume common-mode signal pick-up by the feedline to be the root cause, which 
would be in line with the "filter unit" provided with Sony's AN-LP1 active 
loop, but if anyone knows better, let me know.</p>

<h3 id="loop-fieldimp">Field impedance</h3>

<p>Small loop antennas are also called "magnetic" antennas because they 
primarily react to the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field, i.e. 
their field impedance is low. 
<a href="http://www.w8ji.com/magnetic_receiving_loops.htm">As W8JI points 
out</a>, this only applies for distances up to about &#955;/10, but that's 
usually sufficient to include a large number of in-house interference 
generators with their respective "antennas" of the "electric" variety. Loops 
therefore tend to keep off noise from nearby RFI sources better than their 
"electric" cousins, which is a big plus for in-house operation.</p>

<h3 id="loop-calc">Online loop inductance calculators</h3>

<p>Bruce Carter originally implemented the following two JS calculators for

lately 
(<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.mindspring.com/%7Eloop_antenna">archive.org may help</a>). So here's a modernized metric version of the Joe 
Carr and UMR EMC Lab formulas, with an implementation of the Bob's Tesla Web

Bruce Carter</p>

<p>For my homebrew MW loop, this formula gave an inductance about 15% too 
low. The difference dropped to about 5% after rewinding to a lower shortwave 
loop with twice the wire spacing, at least once I took the correct loop depth 
into account ñ it has to be <code>(turns - 1) * spacing</code>. 
Insulation with non-negligible &#949;<sub>r</sub> (like PVC) increases 
capacitance and decreases effective spacing a bit.</p>

<p>No wonder tx loops are comparatively rare on the lower bands ñ if you 
want any kind of reasonable efficiency, you'll need a good bit of copper tubing 
and a variable capacitor that can take like 6..10&nbsp;kV even on 100&nbsp;W, 
plus remote tuning (you don't want this kind of fieldstrengths in your shack 
for sure) and a rotor. Not exactly a beginner's project. It all gets 
considerably more relaxed in the vicinity of 20&nbsp;m, where a 1 or 1.5&nbsp;m 
dia. loop and ~60&nbsp;pF, 5&nbsp;kV varicap on a short mast should already do 
a pretty good job e.g. as a mobile antenna.</p>

<h2 id="cmp">Comparison time: Short dipole / monopole vs. small loop</h2>

<p>First of all, the best small antenna is one that isn't small. Since, 
however, rotating your array of widely spaced Beverages is just a wee bit 
cumbersome (hi), and many people don't remotely have the space for anything 
close, compact antennas do have their place. So let's examine a few cases:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Portable receiver on batteries, telescopic whip vs. active / 
passive tuned loop:</strong> 
<br>Without a good ground, the 
whip is severely handicapped. Receivers typically don't tune it either, so it's 
operated broadband. Nearby RFI generators with short "electric antennas" don't 
make things any better. The loop does not need an external ground, and since 
it's tuned, can make the most of its modest radiation resistance. Its high 
impedance at resonance is well-suited for FET-based amplifiers, too, and it 
even is somewhat directional so interference sources can be nulled out if 
needed. Winner? Loop, hands down.</li>

<li><strong>Tuned antennas for reception:</strong>
<br>If you want to cover a certain frequency range, tuning a loop is easier for 
sure. Using varicap diodes, you can even do it remotely without too much fuss. 
The same for a monopole or dipole is a good bit more difficult, you'd have to 
keep an antenna tuner nearby. Winner? Generally, loop.</li>

<li><strong>The space-limited amateur wants to transmit:</strong>
<br>This is a far more tricky scenario. Here the smaller radiation resistance 
of the loop (which will necessitate a copper tubing loop and low-loss 
high-voltage capacitor to keep losses down) has to be weighed against matching 
losses when using a dipole or vertical. If in doubt, do the math, or measure 
and simulate.</li>

<li><strong>Stationary broadband reception antenna, active whip vs. active 
loop:</strong>
<br>Again, inconclusive ñ the <code>|X<sub>L,C</sub>|/R<sub>r</sub></code> 
ratio for both behaves in the same way 
(|<code>X<sub>L,C</sub>|/R<sub>r</sub>&nbsp;&#8733;&nbsp;(&#955;/l)≥</code>). 
An active whip well away from interference sources and with proper grounding 
could actually do pretty well. In practice, YMMV.</li>

</ul>

<p>Common-mode chokes in the feedline may be helpful in any case. (Of course 
grounding should only be either at the antenna or at the receiver, not 
both. If there is a ground loop, part of the signal current will be common 
mode.)</p>

<p>Let's sum it up:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Best (with potentially tx-worthy efficiency):</strong> Tuned loop, 
tuned dipole, tuned monopole with good grounding in that order</li>

<li><strong>OK (still useful for rx):</strong> Wideband loop, dipole, and 
monopole with good grounding</li>

<li><strong>Lousy:</strong> Monopole (whip) with no proper grounding</li>

</ul>
