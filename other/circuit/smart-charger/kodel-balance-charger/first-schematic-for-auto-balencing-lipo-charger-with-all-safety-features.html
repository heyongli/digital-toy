			<div><strong>First schematic for auto-balancing LiPo charger with all
 saftey features</strong><br>&nbsp;</div>
		
		
			<div class="smallfont">1 Attachment(s)</div>
		

		<div>I want to get into LiPo batteries but have not found a charger 
that suits my needs.<br>
<br>
My requirements:<br>
- safe &amp; simple operation<br>
- automatically balancing individual cells<br>
- safe in case I try to charge a cell that is discharged too deep<br>
- no damage to LiPo pack in case the charger circuit breaks down (if it 
will get old enough it finally will die)<br>
- safe in case a cell dies during charging (short-circuit)<br>
- dedicated to 1 battery type so I can make no mistakes with connectors 
or settings<br>
- state-of charge monitor so I can decide the cells are charged enough 
for my need and go flying.<br>
<br>
I saw a solution that was charging all cells in parallel, but disliked 
the following:<br>
<br>
- during the flight , the cells where configured in a series pack using a
 purpose-built connector. This means that for 3 cells the current has to
 pass 6 connectors instead of 2, resulting in 3 times more ohmic losses 
and potential for failure<br>
<br>
- during charge, the cells where wired in parallel by another 
purpose-built connector. This means that should a cell be out of 
balance, it will receive the full charge current from the other cells. 
And since discharge current is much higher then max. allowable charge 
current, this abuse will further weaken the weak cell.<br>
<br>
- during charge, should a cell in a pack fail (and eventually one of 
them will fail) by short-circuiting, the other cells will also be in 
short-circuit, potentially resulting in fireworks.<br>
<br>
<br>
So therefore my solution below.<br>
<br>
Short explanation: I set up a current pump, connect the pack to this, 
monitor indivudual cell voltage and when a cell tries to go higher then 
4.2V, I sink the current through an old-fashioned power transistor 
(could have tried FET's and power resistor).<br>
As an extra security measure, I have an additional transistor that can 
break the current completely on two events: the whole pack has a voltage
 lower then 2.5 V (so we should not charge it to avoid danger) or higher
 then 12.7 V (so one of the opamps or transistors has died, or possibly 
an already overcharged pack was attached) I then added a couple of led's
 to give me an idea of state of charge of individual cells (so I would 
know when I have a cell that is particulary weaker then others), going 
brighter when charging is more complete.<br>
<br>
I quickly estimated cost and for 25 Euro the finished charger should be 
doable.<br>
<br>
My question:<br>
<br>
Does the schematic make sense to you experts out there? It's been more 
then a few years that I last designed something using analog stuff!<br>
<br>
So all feedback / ameliorations / scepticism are welcome...</div>

		<div>Hi kodel,<br>
<br>
I was thinking of a circuit with similar features for charging lipos, 
but lazyness got the best of me and I'm building a 'dumb' cc/cv charger.<br>
<br>
I just have one question about your circuit.  After each of the 
comparators that appear to be monitoring the individual cell voltage it 
looks like you have transistors...  they look like they're connected in 
parallel w/ each cell.<br>
Are they really transistors?<br>
<br>
I'm thinking that if one of those transistors ever turned on you might 
have a fireball on your hands - either the transistor or the lipo cell 
is going to blow up, the weaker of the two.<br>
<br>
I see a few other errors in the schematic, but it would be difficult for
 me to go into detail without having references assigned to each part.</div>

		<div>I drew the schematic before reading up on my rusty analog design 
experience. There are major errors in here, the opamps with the 4 
resistors on them should be configured as a differential amplifier with a
 gain of 1. The drawing shows incorrect resistor connections.<br>
I'm now redrawing the thing with Spice with correct opamp 
configurations.<br>
<br>
Towards your note on the transistors: they are indeed power NPN 
transistors, the idea is that they are turned off when the cell voltage 
is below 4.2 V. When the voltage reaches 4.2 V they gradually start to 
absorb the excess charge current. So, when the pack is fully charged, 
they will be absorbing the full charge current (say 1.5 Amps).<br>
The only danger I see is that over time the transistor will break down 
(e.g. after 10 years of usage of maybe much less when no effective 
heatsink is provided).<br>
But even after 10 years I would not want a lipo fire, hence the safety 
circuit drawn at the top.</div>

		<div>Hehe, you're clearly at a further stage of development then I am 
:)<br>
<br>
Attached is the schematic as I'm now drawing it with PSpice, still not 
finished (some resistors to be calculated, replace current sources with 
their equivalent components, etc)<br>
<br>
Do you already have a ballpark figure of MSRP ? I think my design could 
after optimisations and production in China be around 50 dollar, however
 I'm not familiar with distribution structures in the RC niche.<br>

			<div><strong>Simpeler alternative possible?</strong><br>&nbsp;</div>
		
		
			<div class="smallfont">1 Attachment(s)</div>
		

		<div>I am thinking of an idea on replacing the 2 opamps per cell + npn
 shunting transistor with an off-the-shelf linear voltage regulator 
(like LM317), since the components I'm using are actually inside the 
regulator and they are preforming the same function.<br>
<br>
I couldn't figure out how to hook up the regulator, until I came across 
my RSComponents catalog and wondered what the difference was between 
positive linear voltage regulators and negative linear voltage 
regulators. What surprised me even more was that there are types that 
qualify both as a positive and a negative regulator.<br>
<br>
So, I did a small simulation of a positive type. The input voltage 
remains constant, but at the output I have set a voltage source that 
slowly rises from 0V to 20V. For the regulator, this means the load 
diminuishes until it is zero and when the output voltage rises higher 
then the voltage the regulator is programmed for, the load actually 
becomes negative.<br>
<br>
This means that the regulator would need to sink current instead of 
source current. From the simulation graph, it is obvious that a 
positive-only regulator can not do this.<br>
<br>
My goal of replacing 2 opamps + 1 npn + a bunch of resistors with a 
singe regulator with 2 resistors is not possible with the positive 
regulator type, since the only behavious I'm looking for is to sink 
excess current before the cell voltage rises.<br>
<br>
But, what is this negative regulator type? On to the next post...</div>

			<div><strong>A negative regulator should do the trick...</strong><br>&nbsp;</div>
		
		
			<div class="smallfont">1 Attachment(s)</div>
		

		<div><b>Edited on 16/08: this idea is a no/go, forget about it and 
read the next post</b><br>
<br>
So, in my quest for a negative regulator I had the bad luck that in the 
spice emulator the manufacturer did not provide a negative model.<br>
<br>
But looking at a schematic from the competition reveals that the answer 
is simple: a negative regulator is used to create a negative voltage 
from an even more negative input source.<br>
<br>
So, in my limited neural capacity this means the regulator is sinking 
current instead of sourcing, which is what I was looking for!<br>
<br>
And the best news is, even the el cheapo LM317/LM350 is rated as 
positive/negative regulator, which would mean they can both source and 
sink current.<br>
<br>
Can any of you experts out there tell me if this indead would work, 
hooking up a negative regulator over each individual cell and bleeding 
off the current (via Vin of the regulator) to ground (or something 
lower)?<br>
<br>
I am not able to test this at the moment (have to order the regs...)<br>
<br>
note that the component in the image attached has more then 3 leads, but
 this doesn't matter for the application I'm investigating.</div>

			<div><strong>prototype ready and tested</strong><br>&nbsp;</div>
		
		

		<div>Well, after a few months of inactivity with regard to this 
project I finally found an evening to finish it.<br>
I deviated a little from the original plans but with satisfactory 
results<br>
<br>
- I inspired myself (not to say copied) on Suzanne's design of the Lipo 
balancers. I did use some cheaper components however since the MAX is 
quite expensive. (see schematic)<br>
<br>
- I ran into a small problem with my design: Since the comparator I'm 
using has an open collector output, I have to feed the RC filter through
 a pull up resistor. This causes the "on" switching time for the FET's 
to be very long, so they operate in the forward active region for some 
time. Therefore they where getting pretty warm. Since I don't have a 
temperature probe or scope to measure things, I mounted them on a 
cooling fin just to be sure. Now they stay cool.<br>
I could have added a buffer to overcome this problem, but the cooling 
fins where laying around anyway.<br>
<br>
- I used a simple variable voltage regulator as a current source. This 
was my quick way to test the whole of the system setup, but it has the 
disadvantage of having a high drop out voltage. This means I'll not be 
able to charge my 3s lipo's from a car battery without voltage booster.<br>
I don't have a need to recharge at the field and our field has a 
generator anyway's, so to me it's not a problem.<br>
I do have the intention to test my low voltage drop current source 
design however, but it could take some time (I'm quite busy)<br>
<br>
I'll post some pictures / schematics in the following posts</div>

I didn't do any schematics or breadboard design, I just started 
soldering since it's so easy. ON the right you see an LM350 with current
 sensing resistor as a quick current source.<br>

The Multiplex connector is mating to a similar connector on my packs.<br>
I used 4 pins for + and - (2 pins each for lower connector resistance) I
 used the 2 remaining pins for the cell interconnections.<br>

		<div>Here's the schematic.<br>
<br>
The parts are identified on top.<br>
<br>
The second comparator drawn in red is used to alert the user of cell 
undervoltage, so nobody would try to recharge a pack depleted below 3 
volts.<br>
<br>
The resistor R4 is accidentaly crossed out but is an essential part of 
the diagram.<br>
<br>
I tried a few different values for the capacitors (basically cause I 
didn't have 3 identical ones laying around in the order from 10-500nF. 
They all work great, however when the cells start to become full, they 
blink/flicker at different speeds.  I guess the higher the blinking 
speed, the more even the charge current is on the cell, so I'll go with 
10nF on all 3 of them.<br>
<br>
Oh yess, the drawing only illustrates 1 "lipo balancer". You need to 
make 3 of these for a 3s charger and add a LM350 as current limiter to 
the entrance of the circuit.</div>

		<div>The balancers from Suzanne are fine, my design only differs on 
these points:<br>
<br>
pro (for use as part of a charger):<br>
- non-SMD components for easier soldering<br>
- 6 watt resistors to do high-current charging<br>
- cheaper comparator/reference voltage then the MAX component (total BOM
 is only a few euro's)<br>
<br>
cons:<br>
- due to (a little bit tooo) cheap comparator, no output driver so fet's
 might get a little warm. Nothing dramatic, but I decided to but a 
cooling fin on anyways<br>
- more work since no PCB is available so you have to solder it on a 
breadboard. (the whole last design steps / breadboarding / testing part 
took me about 4 hours)<br>

I use FET's now (like every wellmannered designer :) and use a resistor

<br>
PS: in the breadboard you see large ELCO's running top-to-bottom. These 
are connected directly over the LIPO cells to stabilize their voltage a 
little. It's not on the schematic and is not needed really, but I added 
it to stabilize the power supply I was simulating the LIPO's with during
 testing.</div>

</div>that second comparator could be used to stop the charge if cell 
voltage increases too much over the balancer's setpoint, say 50mV above,
 combining balancer and safety guard in one unit.<br>
This would protect against cell overvoltage in case of a total cell 
failure with the need for more balancing current or any failure of the 
balancer (such as a failed resistor R7). A second line of defence for 
those very rare cases.<br>
<br>
I'm thinking of using a car-type relais to interrupt the charge, because
 a relais can take the voltage spike some chargers put out when charge 
is interrupted; 65VDC on my Schulze.<br>
Any idea how one could get a relais to de-energize based on the outputs 
of comparator 2? The problem I see is that comp 2 for each cell has a 
different ground.<br>

<br>
 what do you think about<br>
charging each cells using seperate, galvanically isolated chargers?<br>
they will be balanced to 4.20V after charge.<br>
<br>
i didn't like these transistor things in this trhread, where the 
transistors were directly connected between the cells' 2 terminals, if 
transistor is turned on, dissipating too much power, it will probably 
short out, then blow, or over discharge cell maeby. (in case huge 
transistor)<br>
How do these commercial chargers balance? I whould guess balancing needs
 a little asymmetric current like &lt;0.1C<br>

The resistor R4 is accidentaly crossed out but is an essential part of

I tried a few different values for the capacitors (basically cause I 
didn't have 3 identical ones laying around in the order from 10-500nF. 
They all work great, however when the cells start to become full, they 
blink/flicker at different speeds.  I guess the higher the blinking 
speed, the more even the charge current is on the cell, so I'll go with 
10nF on all 3 of them.<br>

Oh yess, the drawing only illustrates 1 "lipo balancer". You need to 
make 3 of these for a 3s charger and add a LM350 as current limiter to 
the entrance of the circuit.</div>

hehe,<br>

my experimental charger looks a bit like your circuit...<br>
i recommend you tl431A, and TL431B, these are accurate enough to be a li
 charger reference.<br>
i can charge a li pack with 3 opamps, 1 rs, 1 4.20V ref, 1 mosfet, some 
caps, and resistors.<br>
i think i will make it open, simplest automatic DIY Lithium Polimer

		<div>My pcb circuitry was a hand-made design which included beside the
 three balancing blocks a 12V to about 15.5 voltage booster based on 
LM2577-adj. (on a heat sink near the balun) like here: <a 
href="http://www.flyelectric.ukgateway.ne...ium-charger.htm/" 
target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.flyelectric.ukgateway.ne...ium-charger.htm</a>,
 and also a constant current supply based on L200 chip designed to 
provide about 1.8 Amps. It is intended to be supplied by the car 12V 
battery in the field.<br>
<br>
Because the pcb hand-made drawing was drawn in a hurry by pencil and it 
does not look very "presentable", I didn't posted on the forum. As soon 
as I will make an "Eagle" or "Express PCB" design I shall post it.<br>
<br>
I have build the constant current supply as per figure no. 21 of the 
attached datasheet using a BD912 (the other green heatsink in the 
picture) on "the back" of L200 to take over the current load and 
Rsc=0.25ohm/4w = 4pcs x 1ohm/1W to set the 1.8Amps regulated current. 
Pin 4 of L200 it is not used as a voltage reference but simply grounded.<br>
Note: 1% precision resistors should be used for the reference voltage 
divider.</div>

		<div>Hi, I've read thru this thread, and want to make sure that I am 
understanding it all correctly.<br>
<br>
Is the L200 design in post #27 a charger?, and then the one in the last 
post #41 and charger and balancer for a 3 cell lipo together??<br>
<br>
What are the approximate costs for each one??<br>
<br>
I am thinking about building one b/c the charger that I bought died b/c 
of a faulty design, and if the cost to building either one of these is 
manageable I would rather do that, as I am entertained by it anyway. 
Also is there somewhere that has a list of the parts needed to build 
either one of these designs, as I actually have to go to a different 
city to buy this stuff I wouldn't want to forget something.  Thanks a 
lot and looking forward to hearing back.<br>

		<div>hi robin123,<br>
<br>
i assume that i can build the charger/balancer around an LM339 (quad 
comparator)? and if I can make sure that my battery doesn't go below the
 safety level, can I just remove the comparator section that alarms the 
user for a low voltage battery?<br>
<br>
thanks a bunch for the schematic!<br>

 a <i>single supply</i> quad amp, the GND is common (see the LM339

That's an excellent point robin! However, I'm a bit confused now...<br>
<br>
If all the Vref of the comparators are tied to a single voltage 
reference and the Vin of the comparators have separate voltage dividers 
and this voltage dividers are common to each cell only (3 voltage 
dividers for 3S packs), then wouldn't it work?</div>

</div>Let's assume that the charging begins at 3.6V/cell and GND of the 
op-amp is connected to -V of the cell pack. In this case the voltage on 
CT2 wil be 3.6V according to GND. The second op-amp inverting input is 
only 2.5V according to GND, so it is 1.1V <i>below the CT2 junction</i> 
(it should be 2.5V higher), so the starting voltage between its 
inverting input and its non-inverting input will be not negative, 
triggering (opening) the FET and dumping the second cell charging 
current.<br>
<br>
Concluding, I think that the second cell (CT2  CT1) will not start to 
charge, as the charging condition is the inverting input (positive) 
voltage should be higher that the non-inverting input of the op-amp to 
block the FET. For the last cell (CT1  +V) the situation is worse.<br>
<br>
I might be wrong in my thinking, so if you are decided to test 
it...Maybe a proffesional opinion will help.</div>

The voltages you show in your schematic are only correct with respect to
 the negative terminal of that particulart cell, but 2.5 volt voltage 
reference is referenced to the pack negative, so the voltages would be 
as I show in the schematics, assuming that all 3 cells are at 4.2 volts.
 If you try to build it this way, the upper two cells will always be 
discharging. <br>

		<div>Oh boy I didn't see that, since the resistors are all tied 
together from V+ to V- then it will truly be not in the 2.5V range in 
the junction at the top cell since the vref is referenced at V-. I get 
it now! Whew!  :D Thanks Dan and Robin for your patience.<br>

So my LM339s are totally useless for this and I must find some 2903/393

		<div>I have only breadboarded part of this circuit, so there is no 
guarantee that it will work. If you decide to build it, expect to do 
some experimentation and troubleshooting, but I'll help. If I were 
building it for myself, I would use pots instead of fixed resistors for 
the voltage devider, but if you decide to use fixed resistors, you 
should probably use a precision voltage reference like the TL1431ACZ 
(mouser PN 511-TL1421ACZ). Of course this schematic only shows 1 of the 
three balancers needed.<br>

Let me know how it goes.<br>

		<div>Hi Dan.<br>
<br>
I am currently trying to make a home made 3 cell LiPo charger using a 
constant voltage 12.6v (current limited) and 3x cell balancers. I 
ordered some TL431s recently and was working on a schematic fairly 
similar to the one you posted.<br>
<br>
Would you just mind explaining what the purpose of the capacitor is in 
your circuit? I guess it's something to do with the pulsing? Why is 
pulsing required?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Andy P.</div>

		<div>Pulsing is not required. I was just suggesting an alternative to 
the circuit that had already been posted, which does pulse. Yes, the 
capacitor makes certain that the TL431 does not operate in linear mode, 
so it pulses. Pulsing makes sure that the power dissipation is in the 
resistor, not the transistor, and in this case it simplifies the LED 
circuit. In the linear balancers that I've posted here in the past, 
there had to be a separate transistor for the LED. Almost all commercial
 balancers pulse, but that's mostly because they use microcontrollers 
instead of linear devices. The rate of the pulsing gives you an idea of 
how far out of balance the pack is. <br>

		<div>Hmm, this is been a while...<br>
<br>
Without looking at the circuit, the capacitor would be to prevent the 
FET from going into a state between full ON and full OFF. (forward 
active region, if I recall my electronics correct) This is not desired, 
since then all of the energy will be dissipated in the FET. We want the 
FET to always be either ON or OFF. That's why the capacitor is added: to
 slow down the changes in voltage, creating a low pass filter so the 
capacitor goes on/off at a certain frequency (about 1 Hz if I look at my
 charger). The voltage-too-low warning led's (the read ones) also verry 
briefly blink at this frequency.</div>

		<div>I am using IRL520. The most important thing is that it has a gate
 threshold voltage of 1-2v and not 2-4v. In the data sheet, this may be 
abbreviated as Vgs(th). This is important as the whole circuit is 
powered on only 4 volts, and when the PNP transistor turns on, remember 
the diode drop of the BC junction will mean that the collector is only 
at 3.6V. If you used a normal FET, it would either not turn on, or be in
 the linear region, getting very hot.<br>
<br>
Vgs(th) of 1-2v are known as logic level mosfets.  :D</div>
